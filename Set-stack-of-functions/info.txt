/*
Here we use a function pointer to select one of the functions (, , or ). 
The functions we want to use are associated with text strings 
in the array.fnothing()functionA()functionB()commands[]

When some serial data is available, we read until the end
of the line (or until the buffer named is full, or until a timeout occurs) and loop through 
the array to see whether we can find a match. 
If a match was found, the function pointer is updated accordingly.textf

Needless to say, there is lots of room for improvement.
